elif page == "FAQs":

        **Q: How does the bacteria counting process work?**
        A: The application analyzes the uploaded image to detect and count the contours representing bacteria on hands. 

        **Q: What does the bacteria count indicate?**
        A: The bacteria count provides an estimate of the microbial load on the hands, which can be an indicator of hygiene. 

        **Q: What are the bacteria count thresholds?**
        A: 
        - A count below 30 indicates clean hands.
        - A count between 30 and 100 suggests moderate bacterial presence, indicating a need for washing hands soon.
        - A count above 100 suggests high bacterial presence, recommending immediate cleaning.

        **Q: Can the application differentiate between types of bacteria?**
        A: No, the application counts contours in the image, but it does not identify specific types of bacteria. It provides a general count based on visible markers.

        **Q: How accurate is the bacteria count?**
        A: The accuracy may vary based on image quality and lighting conditions. Proper lighting and a clear image of hands can improve results.

        **Q: Can this application be used for other surfaces or just hands?**
        A: Currently, the application is designed specifically for detecting bacteria on hands. Future updates may expand its functionality.

        **Q: What should I do if the bacteria count seems unusually high?**
        A: If the count is high, it is recommended to wash your hands thoroughly with soap and water to reduce bacterial load.
